# Valheim Mods

You will need the attached mods in order to join, I've tried to not go completely overboard but instead included some QoL improvements like shared map progression and item quick slots (All Mods will be listed below) 

## Example of included mods
Valheim Legends is best described by the mod page as it's......big
https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/796

Same with VelhimPlus, although we have 99% of the mod completely disabled (except shared map progression)
https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/4

Smart Containers is another where the mod page is probably better
https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/332?tab=files&file_id=9926

MassFarming allows mass picking of crops

and config manager is just for setting the config for mods, they're usually fine left default (and the included ones are default), ValheimPlus is the only one that's edited to inherit the config of the server rather than local

BiggerItemStacks, EquipmentandQuickSlots, EquipMultipleItems, RepairAll, FarmGrid and NetworkFix are self explanatory

## How to download
Click `ValheimMods` from the Releases bar on the right, then select `ValheimMods.zip` to start the download.

## Installation
Navigate to your Valheim directory (Right click Valheim on Steam, go to `Manage` and `Browse Local Files`).
Download and open `ValheimMods.zip`, then copy all of the included files & folders to your Valheim folder and replace if asked.
